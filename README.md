# SEEDO.AI

## Project Summary: SEEDO.AI - An Intelligent Document and Object Extraction System

SEEDO.AI (**SE**cure **E**xtraction and **D**ata **O**.rganization with **AI**) is an integrated project utilizing computer vision and machine learning for automated data capture and organization. The system comprises three core modules:

1. **Attendance Tracking System:** This module leverages OpenCV for facial recognition and real-time attendance tracking.

2. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** This module employs TensorFlow to extract text from documents like employee bills and salary slips, enabling automatic data population.

3. **Car Plate Detection and Recognition:** This module utilizes OpenCV and machine learning algorithms to identify and extract car license plate numbers.

**Integration and Functionality:**  SEEDO.AI integrates these modules to process visual data (images/videos). The system categorizes and stores extracted information (attendance data, document text, car plate numbers) in a dedicated database. 

**Technologies:** The project utilizes a combination of powerful technologies including:

* OpenCV: Open-source computer vision library for facial recognition, object detection, and image processing.
* TensorFlow: Open-source machine learning framework for building and deploying OCR models.
* Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Automates repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency.
* Machine Learning Algorithms: Specialized algorithms for various tasks like car plate recognition.

**Benefits:** SEEDO.AI offers several advantages such as:

* **Automated Data Capture:** Eliminates manual data entry, reducing errors and saving time.
* **Improved Data Accuracy:**  Reduces human error in data transcription.
* **Enhanced Security:** Securely stores and categorizes extracted data.
* **Streamlined Workflows:** Enables automation of data acquisition tasks in various applications.
